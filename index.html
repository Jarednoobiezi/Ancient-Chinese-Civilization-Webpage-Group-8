      The Ancient Chinese civilization started and developed at 2 impotant
      rivers/regions: <b>The Huang He</b> or <b>“Yellow” River</b> to the

      These are very fertile regions however the land needs irrigation to
      make the crops grow, and wellbuilt river embankments to prevent <b
      >catastrophic flooding. </b>The  river helps create fertile land
      suited for farming, during certain times of the year.
